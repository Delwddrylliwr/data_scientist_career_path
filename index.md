##DRAFT: THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY

# The Data Scientist career path 

**Developed by the Digital, Data and Technology and Government Analytical Professions (GORS, GSS, GES & GSR)**

Data Scientists solve complex business problems using their knowledge of the problem domain and their coding, statistics and machine learning skills on large and varied datasets.

This document:

* Is for those interested in working as Data Scientists in government (such as other government technologists or analysts) or are already Data Scientists.
* Explains the knowledge, skills and behaviours expected at each career stage;
* Illustrates example career paths and how they relate to other functions within government;
* Provides the opportunity to identify personal developmental and learning requirements.

## What government Data Scientists do

Data Scientists:

* use large and varied datasets to tackle complex business problems that often span a range of services or departments;
* apply their technical expertise in a range of coding, statistics and machine learning disciplines to produce innovative approaches;
* work with a range of other professions in a collaborative, agile manner to understand the problem and structure analytical approaches using a wider range of data than is normally used in that business area;
* build scalable data products that can be used by strategic or operational users and can be further integrated into business systems;
* communicate the value of the data product to stakeholders and convince them of the data science opportunity.

## How they do it: 

* Identifying complex business problems where leveraging data value can support strategic and operational decision making;
* Sourcing, accessing, manipulating and engineering data processes with data that typically have characteristics of volume, velocity and/or variety;
* Building credible statistical models from the data and using best coding practices to generate reproducible work;
* Being open minded and relentlessly curious. This interdisciplinary focus on using techniques and knowledge from across scientific spectrum is a key characteristic of being a data scientist;
* Exploring and visualising the data to create a data narrative to present the ‘story’ of the data in a meaningful way to a range of technical and non-technical audiences;
* Using an evolving range of data analysis tools and techniques, including open source - some of which they learn quickly as and when required;
* Continuously seeking to expand their range of technical skills in addition to their leadership and communications development;
* Understanding the variety of functional roles relating to data science and how they can be most effectively applied to solve the business problem;
* Working in an open, transparent and collaborative manner, sharing good practice, and seeking to continuously improve quality of outputs.

## What is the career promise for Data Scientists in government? 

You will:

* Improve government services using data and make a meaningful difference to people's lives;
* Revolutionise government by solving large, challenging problems using data science approaches;
* Build up a strong portfolio of data-intensive projects as a hands-on technical leader;
* You will demonstrate your technical leadership by coding on a regular (ideally daily) basis. This is for all levels of seniority.
* Gain technical experience working in multidisciplinary agile teams;
* Belong to a high profile, well-respected cross government data science community.

## How to use the career path

Use this document in career planning conversations with your line manager along with the Civil Service competencies. The career path shows the expected knowledge, skills and behaviours that will be demonstrated by people at different stages of their career.

The items in the table can be used as a starting point for a conversation, and to identify general areas in which you can develop.

One way to use the career path as a means of structuring a conversation is to highlight skills in the table below that you’re interested in developing. For instance:

* I can do this and want to do more
* I can’t do this and want to do more
* I can do this and don’t want to do more
* I can’t do this and I’m not interested

The skills and responsibilities at each level carry through to more senior levels (grades indicative).
